# IOS-XR 7.7.1 


## Key Technology Updates in 7.7.1: 
Segment Routing, EVPN, BGP, Software Only, RON, Peering, and Security

## IOS-XR 7.7.1 Software Availability
IOS-XR 7.7.1 is Generally Available (GA) for release. 8000, ASR9K 64-bit, NCS5500/NCS5700, NCS560, NCS540, XRv9K, and XRd are supported in this release. Whitebox (SW only) is supported in this release. 

## Overview 
- Feature updates among technologies 
- Software PID's for product portfolio 
- New hardware supported 


## Segment Routing

Cisco Optimization Engine (COE) v4.0 requires optimization in certain capabilities within SR-PCE. XR 7.7.1 features the ability to configure a centralized solution to override PCC-initiated objectives and help the customer deploy constraints as override actions. 

  1.	Improve automation product 
  2.	Help brown-field client
  3.	Remove limitations on platforms 

### Crosswork Optimization Engine (COE) 4.0 
- First in industry for customer to visualize their multicast tree live in the network 
- Enable visualization of tree-sid use cases in multicast
- Double COE scale

### SRv6-Services: 
- L2 EVPN QoS Enhancement
- L3 Services QoS Enhancement

### SR-PCE: Objective override of PCC-Initiated policies
- Several customers (such as Vodafone, Telstra, others) have old devices in the network where, as an example, the old PCC is able to delegate computation of IGP metric policies but does not support a PCC-initiated “low delay” policy.
- In such deployments, a centralized solution (PCE-centric) can be implemented to “override” a PCC-initiated optimization objective (ex: IGP cost) to another objective (ex: delay) and help the customer deploy the intended policy SLA albeit this PCC limitation.



## EVPN 

Private Line Emulation (PLE) service is a method for encapsulating high-speed bit-streams as VPWS over packet switched networks (PSN). This emulation suits applications where complete signal transparency is required and data interpretation of the PE would be counterproductive. 
 
- VPWS (ELINE) - Private Line Emulation (PLE): single homing 
---- 

- EVPN updates in L2 Gateway provide IGMPv3 Selective multicast (RT-6) w/ Proxy support 
- (L2 + L3) Anycast GW: IGMPv3 Selective multicast (RT-6) w/ Proxy support 


## SW Only Updates for DDC
- Testing and improvements for DCI and L3VPN 
- Scalable improvements for hybrid DCI by compressing memory entries and expandability 
- Peering use cases in BGP flowspec 
- Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) and port mirroring updates for monitoring and mitigation actions for security threats such as DDoS attacks
- Supports BGP Route Groups (RG) to allow customers to control VPN routing by subscribing up to 12 pre-defined RGs 


## Security
- Radware Detect Pro integration provides critical protection for DDOS attacks for SP infrastructure 
- This update contains improvements to strengthen security by increasing password protection among the following platforms: IOS-XR, NCS5000, NCS5500, NCS5700, ASR9000, ASR9900, NCS540, NCS560, to meet enhanced password guidelines. 

## Coming Soon
- EVPN - PLE support 
- Updates to DDC features to support key customers such as AT&T
- 7.8.1
