author: Akshat Sharma
excerpt: >-
  We walk through the drivers behind the creation of an auditing app that can
  periodically collect information from XR LXC, Admin LXC and Host Shells of
  IOS-XR 6.1.2+  and stream out a schema-based XML dump of the linux environment
  state to a remote server over SSH.
