We're up at NANOG 67 in Chicago, IL, next week!

Over the course of more than 2 decades, the **N**orth **A**merican **N**etwork **O**perators' **G**roup ([NANOG](https://www.nanog.org)) has been at the epicenter of the net-ops transformation.    
This unique congregation of vendors, service-provider, Data-Center and Enterprise SMEs and network engineers provides a perfect opportunity to showcase some of the new enhancements in IOS-XR.   


As always, there is a fair bit of Cisco participation, with content focused on Streaming Telemetry, connectivity evaluation techniques and remediation techniques using Linux applications.
Of course, if you're looking to talk about IOS-XR and other Cisco solutions for the Web, Data Center and Service Provider domain, you'll find a lot of us roaming about!

If you're heading over to NANOG 67,  then check out the following sessions to get a gist of the upcoming enhancements in IOS-XR:

**Beer-n-Gear Demo Booth: iperf driven OSPF path remediation demo**  
Tuesday, June 14 2016:  6:00 - 8:00 pm.  
Akshat Sharma, Cisco Systems

That's a lot to look out for! But as part of the application-hosting team in IOS-XR, we're particularly excited about showing you the underlying linux infrastructure in IOS-XR and its integration with typical linux applications.
At the Beer-n-Gear demo booth, We will have our own booth showcasing some cool new tricks with IOS-XR.  

   
   
The demo would be based off the following application on Github:   

<https://github.com/ios-xr/ospf-iperf-ncclient>:

The figure below should pretty much explain what we're going for:  

![iperf based OSPF path remediation](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a30938cc2dd9c0788b701677fbb5398bc5bb6646/68747470733a2f2f7872646f63732e6769746875622e696f2f7872646f63732d696d616765732f6173736574732f7475746f7269616c2d696d616765732f6f7370665f6e635f69706572662e6a7067)  
  
  

We'll show how you can bring up Containers on XR to run iperf with XR interfaces, and leverage [YDK](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ydk-py) to affect OSPF path cost.

Further, We bring you these demos using the new [IOS-XR Vagrant box](https://xrdocs.github.io/getting-started/iosxr-vagrant-beta) that is currently in private-beta.  
If you haven't heard about it yet, take a look at the following quick-start guide to get you going:

**See you in Chicago!**
