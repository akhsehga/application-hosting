# Intro 

Did you think about logging in IOS-XR Linux shell? With Linux adaption, we will align our techniques and operations flow with server world. There should as little as possible difference in terms of operations. 
In this tutorial, we are going to cover routers configuration to stream Syslog message and acceptance those messages on Ubuntu machine with Syslog-ng and Elastic stack.

# rsyslog

What is rsyslog and why we should care? 

rsyslog is the Rocket-fast SYStem for LOG processing.

It offers high-performance, excellent security features, and a modular design. While it started as a regular syslogd, rsyslog has evolved into a kind of swiss army knife of logging, being able to accept inputs from a wide variety of sources, transform them, and output to the results to diverse destinations.

RSYSLOG can deliver over one million messages per second to local destinations when limited processing is applied (based on v7, December 2013). Even with remote destinations and more elaborate processing the performance is usually considered "stunning". The crucial advantage over traditional syslog â€“ the capability to send messages to remote receivers. 

From the other advantages we could highlight following items: 

- Multi-threading
- TCP, SSL, TLS, RELP
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and more
- Filter any part of syslog message
- Fully configurable output format

## Package installation on IOS-XR

By default, syslog is utilized on IOS-XR Guest OS. We will replace it rsyslog. To do it, we will need to get the package installed on the router. 

There are two options to get rpm on the box: 
- SCP
- Installation via YUM

If you are going to use SCP, you can grab package [directly](https://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/xr600/3rdparty/x86_64/) and copy it to the router. 


```
[Canonball:~]$ yum install localonly -y rsyslog-7.4.4-r0.0.core2_64.rpm
```

If you want to use YUM and your router has external connectivity, you may download rpm right from the router and install it via YUM.


Based on your setup, which may vary, make sure you have DNS server configured on the router.
{: .notice--info}  

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Canonball#conf t
Mon May 28 00:56:06.322 UTC
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Canonball(config)#domain name-server 1.1.1.1

RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Canonball(config)#commit
Mon May 28 00:56:25.687 UTC
```

Once name-server applied in XR CLI config, it will be represented in XR Linux shell: 

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Canonball#bash
Mon May 28 00:57:19.519 UTC
[Canonball:~]$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
domain local
search local
nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
```

If your device is behind a proxy, configure it in XR Linux shell: 
{: .notice--info}  


```
[Canonball:~]$ export http_proxy=http://proxy.custom.com:80/
[Canonball:~]$ export https_proxy=http://proxy.custom.com:80/
```

Proceed with YUM for package installation:

```
[Canonball:~]$ yum-config-manager --add-repo https://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/xr600/3rdparty/x86_64/

```

To send messages to the remote server, we will need to configure rsyslog, in particular modify its configuration file _/etc/rsyslog.conf_

For TCP we will use @@

For UDP we will use @


String below will allow us to send all messages via TCP:

```code
*.* @@<remote_ip>:514
```

If there is an intention to offload messages to Elasticsearch, we will need to convert them to JSON format. There are two ways how to do that:

1. Format incoming messages received on the server side; 
2. Send messages directly in JSON format. 

We will elaborate on example with the second option. To convert a message to JSON format we will add the template to rsyslog configuration file. 

```
template(name="JsonFormat"
  type="list") {
    constant(value="{")
      constant(value="\"@timestamp\":\"")     property(name="timereported" dateFormat="rfc3339")
      constant(value="\",\"@version\":\"1")
      constant(value="\",\"message\":\"")     property(name="msg" format="json")
      constant(value="\",\"sysloghost\":\"")  property(name="hostname")
      constant(value="\",\"severity\":\"")    property(name="syslogseverity-text")
      constant(value="\",\"facility\":\"")    property(name="syslogfacility-text")
      constant(value="\",\"programname\":\"") property(name="programname")
      constant(value="\",\"procid\":\"")      property(name="procid")
    constant(value="\"}\n")
}
```

Template is defined, next step to apply it: 

```
*.* @<remote_ip>:10514;JsonFormat
```

With such configuration, the router will send messages to 2 destinations, one in plain text format to port 514 and another in JSON format to port 10514.

Out of box Logstash supports UDP, TCP available via "[TCP input plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-inputs-tcp.html)". To not to ample our guide, we will stick to UDP for now. 
{: .notice--info}  


Validate the rsyslog config. No errors? All set!

```
rsyslogd -N1
```

Some extra commands, which will help you to do the health check on your setup. To check rsyslog version running:

```
rsyslogd -version
```

Check the Linux system log for rsyslog errors. You should see an event that it started and no errors. Some logs may also be in /var/log/syslog.

```
sudo cat /var/log/messages | grep rsyslog
```

Restart rsyslog to enable the changes applied to the configuration:

```
[Macrocarpa:~]$ service syslog restart
stopping rsyslogd ... done
starting rsyslogd ... done
```


If you decide to utilize rsyslog version 8+, make sure you have library libestr version 1.9+
{: .notice--info}  


## Filters

rsyslog provides the comprehensive set of filters and rules. By specifying *.* in config file, we determine that all information from all facilities would be sent to the remote location.  
What if we want to exclude some facilities from sending process?  Adding **;** should solve this case.

```code
*.*;mail  
# will match all facilities, except mail

auth.warn 
# will match facility auth, with security level 'warning' or higher
```

What would be filter example? Let's say we want to search **msg** property of the incoming Syslog message, for a specific string and pipe it to the custom file. All messages with substring   _pam_unix(crond:session):_  now logged to _ncs-custom.log_

```
:msg, contains, "pam_unix(crond:session)" -/var/log/syslog-ng/ncs-custom.log
```

Keep in mind, that filters are case-sensitive. 'Pam' or 'PAM' will not be filtered.
{: .notice--warning}  


Official documentation with notification levels and more on filters [here](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/filters.html). 


# Configuring server side

On a server side (aka receiver) we will run syslog-ng to get messages from routers in plain text. Syslog-ng would be run natively (docker image also [available](https://syslog-ng.com/blog/central-log-server-docker/)) and Elastic (Logstash + Elasticsearch) would start in docker container for easier deployment. 


## syslog-ng

If you running Ubuntu, apt-get could be used to install syslog-ng. 

```
sudo apt-get install syslog-ng -y
```

Check that installation was successful. With apt, you will not get latest version of software, but it will serve our purpose without limitations. 

```
% syslog-ng --version
syslog-ng 3.5.6
Installer-Version: 3.5.6
Revision: 3.5.6-2.1 [@416d315] (Ubuntu/16.04)
Compile-Date: Oct 24 2015 03:49:19
```

Next step would be to modify Syslog configuration file _/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf_
Following config lines will open port for listening and write all messages to file ncs.log


```
source s_net {
    tcp(ip(0.0.0.0), port(514));
    udp(ip(0.0.0.0), port(514));
};

destination logfiles {
   file("/var/log/syslog-ng/ncs.log");
};

log {
    source(s_net);
    destination(logfiles);
};

```
    
The syslog-ng service should listen on all IP address, because we specify 0.0.0.0 and TCP/UDP port 514. If you want to listen on specific IP, just replace zeroes. 

```
$ netstat -tulpn | grep 514
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:514             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -
udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:514             0.0.0.0:*                           -
```

## Elastic stack

With open source software, such as Elasticsearch and Logstash provide the tools to transform and store our log data.

Before installation, we can verify message receiving in JSON format on the server side, **netcat** serves this purpose.

```
nc -ul server_ip 10514

{"@timestamp":"2018-06-03T19:10:01.524244+00:00","@version":"1","message":" pam_unix(crond:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0)","sysloghost":"Red_Pine","severity":"info","facility":"authpriv","programname":"crond","procid":"21501"}
{"@timestamp":"2018-06-03T19:10:01.524813+00:00","@version":"1","message":" (root) CMD (/usr/bin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf >/dev/null 2>&1)","sysloghost":"Red_Pine","severity":"info","facility":"cron","programname":"CROND","procid":"21502"}
```

To proceed with installation we will pull images: 

```
docker pull docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash:6.2.4
docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.2.4
```

To let Logstash be aware of incoming rsyslog messages, we should provide configuration file logstash.conf:

```
# Logstash will wait for input on port 10514;
# server_ip -> ip of our machine;
# codec, specifies "json" receiving format
# "rsyslog" type used for identification messaging streams in the pipeline.
input {
  udp {
    host => "server_ip"
    port => 10514
    codec => "json"
    type => "rsyslog"
  }
}
# Filter block is empty, could be used in future
filter { }
output {
  if [type] == "rsyslog" {
    elasticsearch {
      hosts => [ "server_ip:9200" ]
    }
  }
}
```

Run the containers! For Logstash container you can mount the whole folder with config files, or specify files directly. 

```
docker run -itd --rm --name=logstash --network host -v ~/Documents/elastic/:/usr/share/logstash/config/ docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash:6.2.4 

docker run -itd -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 --name=elasticsearch  -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.2.4

```

To verify, that Logstash is sending data to Elasticsearch, open a browser  _http://server_ip:9200/_all/_search?q=*&pretty_ 
You should see the output from rsyslog: 
```
{
      "_index" : "logstash-monitoring",
      "_type" : "rsyslog",
      "_id" : "d9tyx2MBc17MjdSrF223",
      "_score" : 1.0,
      "_source":{"@timestamp":"2018-06-03T21:00:44.739673+00:00","@version":"1","message":" + /dev/pts/8 root:root","sysloghost":"Red_Pine","severity":"info","facility":"authpriv","programname":"su","procid":"24267"}
    },
```

Congratulations, all your software is up and running! 


## logrotate 

It's worth to mention one critical component for logging solution. Space on your hard drive is finite. It's worth investing some amount of time to configure proper rules for your machine to free up space. [Logrorate](https://syslog-ng.com/documents/html/syslog-ng-ose-latest-guides/en/syslog-ng-ose-guide-admin/html/example-logrotate.html) is a perfect solution for that. 
Let's take a look at configuration excerpts for ncs.log:

```
cisco@walnut ~ % cat /etc/logrotate.d/apt
/var/log/syslog-ng/ncs.log {
  rotate 24
  monthly
  compress
  missingok
  notifempty
}
```
- **rotate 24** - 24 old log files saved;
- **monthly** - rotation frequency;
- **compress** - gzip used by default, to compress old log files;
- **missingok** - no errors if log file is missing;
- **notifempty** - skip rotate, if log file is empty. 

With such simple addition, your hard drive capacity will last longer. 

# Conclusion

Your logs streamed via rsyslog to multiple destinations: syslog-ng and Logstash. Consider visualization with some tools like Kibana or another piece of software and grow up your log system!
