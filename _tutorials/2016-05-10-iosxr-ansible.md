## Introduction
The goal of this tutorial is to set up an environment that is identical for Windows, Linux or Mac-OSX users.   
So instead of setting up Ansible directly on the User's Desktop/Host, we simply spin up an Ubuntu vagrant instance to host our Ansible playbooks and environment. Let's call it **devbox**. We'll do a separate tutorial on using Ansible directly on Mac-OSX/Windows.
{: .notice--info}  


## Prerequisites
- Computer with 4-5GB free RAM;
- Vagrant;
- Ansible;
- IOS-XRv Vagrant Box
- [Vagrantfile and scripts for provisioning](https://github.com/ios-xr/vagrant-xrdocs/tree/master/ansible-tutorials)

>
**IOS-XR Vagrant is currently in Private Beta**  
>
We explain the steps to in the section below:

### Vagrant pre-setup

Clone the repo with Vagrantfile and assisting files:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ios-xr/vagrant-xrdocs.git
$ cd vagrant-xrdocs/ansible-tutorials/
$ ls
ubuntu.sh*  Vagrantfile  xr-config
```

Setup was tested on Windows, but the workflow is the same for other environments. To add an IOS-XR box, you must first download it.

>
**IOS-XR Vagrant is currently in Private Beta**  
>
To download the box, you will need an **API-KEY** and a **CCO-ID**
>
To get the API-KEY and a CCO-ID, browse to the following link and follow the steps:   
>
[Steps to Generate API-KEY]({{ site.url }}/getting-started/steps-download-iosxr-vagrant)
{: .notice--danger}


<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
$ BOXURL="http://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/appdevci-release/XRv64/latest/iosxrv-fullk9-x64.box"

$ curl <b><mark>-u your-cco-id:API-KEY</mark></b> $BOXURL --output ~/iosxrv-fullk9-x64.box

$ vagrant box add --name IOS-XRv ~/iosxrv-fullk9-x64.box
</code>
</pre>
</div>

Of course, you should replace  your-cco-id with your actual Cisco.com ID and API-KEY with the key you generated and copied using the above [link]({{ site.url }}/getting-started/steps-download-iosxr-vagrant).
{: .notice--danger}  


Image for devbox will be downloaded from official source:

```shell
$ vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64
```    
We should now have both the boxes available, Use the ``vagrant box list`` command to display the current set of boxes on your system as shown below:  


![Box validation](https://xrdocs.github.io/xrdocs-images/assets/tutorial-images/xr-ansible-tutorial/xr_ansible_01_box_list.png){: .align-center}
{: .notice}

The Vagrantfile contains 2 Vagrant boxes and looks like:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|

  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: "echo Hello User"

  config.vm.define "devbox" do |devbox|
    devbox.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
    devbox.vm.network :private_network, virtualbox__intnet: "link1", ip: "10.1.1.10"
    devbox.vm.provision :shell, path: "ubuntu.sh", privileged: false
  end

  config.vm.define "xr" do |xr|
    xr.vm.box = "xrv64"
    xr.vm.network :private_network, virtualbox__intnet: "link1", ip: "10.1.1.20"
  end
   
end

```

Now we are ready to boot up the boxes:

```shell
mkorshun@MKORSHUN-2JPYH MINGW64 ~/Documents/workCisco/tutorial
$ ls
ubuntu.sh*  Vagrantfile  xr-config

mkorshun@MKORSHUN-2JPYH MINGW64 ~/Documents/workCisco/tutorial
$ vagrant up
```


### devbox box pre-configuration  

To access the devbox box just issue the command (no password required):

```shell
vagrant ssh devbox
```

The devbox instance is already configured via file ["ubuntu.sh"](https://github.com/Maikor/IOSXR-Ansible-tutorial/blob/master/ubuntu.sh). This section is only for the user's information.
{: .notice--warning}

>
Let's review the content of the script ["ubuntu.sh"](https://github.com/Maikor/IOSXR-Ansible-tutorial/blob/master/ubuntu.sh)  
The first four lines are responsible for downloading required packages for Ansible and updating the system. 
>
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python-setuptools python-dev build-essential git libssl-dev libffi-dev sshpass
sudo easy_install pip 
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | sudo python
```
>
Next, the script clones the  Ansible and the  IOSXR-Ansible repos:
>
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ios-xr/iosxr-ansible.git
git clone git://github.com/ansible/ansible.git --recursive
```
>
It then installs Ansible and applies the variables from "ansible_env" to the system.
>
```shell
cd ansible/ && sudo python setup.py install
echo "source /home/vagrant/iosxr-ansible/remote/ansible_env" >> /home/vagrant/.profile
```
>
The last section is responsible for generating a public key for paswordless authorization (for XR linux) and a base 64 version of it (for XR CLI):
>
```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa -q -P ""
cut -d" " -f2 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | base64 -d > ~/.ssh/id_rsa_pub.b64
```  
{: .notice--info}


### IOS-XRv box pre-configuration

To access XR Linux Shell:   

```shell
$ vagrant ssh rtr
```

To access XR console it takes one additional step to figure out port (credentials for ssh: vagrant/vagrant):

```shell
mkorshun@MKORSHUN-2JPYH MINGW64 ~/Documents/workCisco/tutorial
$ vagrant port rtr
The forwarded ports for the machine are listed below. Please note that
these values may differ from values configured in the Vagrantfile if the
provider supports automatic port collision detection and resolution.
 22 (guest) = 2223 (host)
 57722 (guest) = 2200 (host)  
 
mkorshun@MKORSHUN-2JPYH MINGW64 ~/Documents/workCisco/tutorial
$ ssh -p 2223 vagrant@localhost
vagrant@localhost's password:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#
```

Now, let's configure an IP address on the IOS-XRv instance. Issue the following command on XR cli:

```
conf t
hostname xr
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0
 ipv4 address 10.1.1.20 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
!
commit
end
```

Checking connectivity between boxes:

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#ping 10.1.1.10
Mon May  9 08:36:33.071 UTC
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.1.1.10, timeout is 2 seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/5/20 ms
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#
```

### Configure Passwordless Access into XR Linux shell
Let's copy public part of key from **devbox** box and allow access without password. 
First,  connect to the devbox instance and copy file to XR via SCP:

```shell
vagrant ssh devbox  

scp -P 57722 /home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  vagrant@10.1.1.20:/home/vagrant/id_rsa_ubuntu.pub
```

Now add the copied keys to authorized_keys in XR linux

```shell
vagrant ssh rtr  

cat /home/vagrant/id_rsa_ubuntu.pub >> /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Configure Passwordless Access into XR CLI
If we want passwordless SSH from devbox to XR CLI, issue the following commands in XR CLI:


The first command uses scp to copy the public key (base 64 encoded) to XR.   
Once we have the key locally, we import it using XR CLI's ``crypto key import`` command.  

**Execute in XR CLI**
{: .text-center}
{: .notice--warning}
```
scp vagrant@10.1.1.10:/home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa_pub.b64 /disk0:/id_rsa_pub.b64

crypto key import authentication rsa disk0:/id_rsa_pub.b64
```

File "id_rsa_pub.b64" was created by provisioning script "Ubuntu.sh", during Vagrant provisioning.


## Using Ansible Playbooks

### Ansible Pre-requisites

On the devbox box let's configure Ansible prerequisites. 
We need to configure 2 files:

1. File "ansible_hosts":  It contains the ip address of the XR instance.
We also specify a user to connect to the machine: "ansible_ssh_user=vagrant"

2. File "ansible_env": Used to set up the environment for Ansible.

We do not delve into [YDK](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ydk-py-samples) for now, it's a topic for another tutorial. Note that the files ansible_hosts and ansible_env are preconfigured for our needs. 


```shell
cd iosxr-ansible/
cd remote/

vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/iosxr-ansible/remote$ cat ansible_hosts
[ss-xr]
10.1.1.20 ansible_ssh_user=vagrant

vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/iosxr-ansible/remote$ cat ansible_env
export BASEDIR=/home/vagrant
export IOSXRDIR=$BASEDIR/iosxr-ansible
export ANSIBLE_HOME=$BASEDIR/ansible
export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=$IOSXRDIR/remote/ansible_hosts
export ANSIBLE_LIBRARY=$IOSXRDIR/remote/library
export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=$IOSXRDIR/remote/ansible_cfg
export YDK_DIR=$BASEDIR/ydk/ydk-py
export PYTHONPATH=$YDK_DIR

```

### Running Playbooks  
  
  ![01-dnx-fe3600.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/01-dnx-fe3600.jpg)


```shell
cd ~/iosxr-ansible/remote/  

ansible-playbook samples/iosxr_get_facts.yml   

ansible-playbook iosxr_cli.yml -e 'cmd="show interface brief"' 
```

Usual playbook would look like:  

![Playbook content](https://xrdocs.github.io/xrdocs-images/assets/tutorial-images/xr-ansible-tutorial/ansible_tutorial_cat_playbook.png){: .align-center}
{: .notice}

Output from our XR instance:

![Playbook result](https://xrdocs.github.io/xrdocs-images/assets/tutorial-images/xr-ansible-tutorial/ansible_tutorial_run_playbook.png){: .align-center}
{: .notice}

Samples folder contains various playbooks, files started with "show_" using iosxr_cli playbook and passing cmd to XR as parameter. To run playbook as "vagrant" user, playbook should contain string: "become: yes"
Feel free to play with any playbook!
